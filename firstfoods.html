<h2> Getting Started </h2>
<p> When I introduced James to solid food at 6 months, we started out traditionally with purees.  Even then James insisted on feeding <span style= "color:red";> himself</span>...</p> <p> I had been very excited to start, but he wasn't as interested as I thought he would be. He would have a few bites and then spend the rest of the meal throwing his spoon on the floor.  I was starting to get concerned, because James was exclusively breast-fed and getting iron from solid foods becomes important at this age. </p> 
<br>
<p> Meanwhile, I noticed that he did seem interested in my food.  I had heard about an approach called baby-led weaning, where you skip purees altogether and start with soft finger food that baby feeds himself.  Frankly, it sounded messy and a choking risk.  But with the purees not really working for us, I revisited the idea of trying BLW.  </p>
<br>
<p> I read a few books and websites about getting started and learned the best foods are ones that can be cut about the size of your pinky that are soft enough to mash between your thumb and index finger raw or with steaming or roasting.  We started off with toast, steamed zucchini and roasted apple slices. He loved it!  </p>
<br>
<p>After getting comfortable with vegetables and fruits, I started giving him very tender slow-cooked beef, chicken and pork.  He really enjoys the meat and over the past month has gotten much better at eating.  I also offer him small sips of water throughout mealtime.   
<br>
<br>
<h2> What to do with all the jars of baby food </h2>
<p> Since James barely ate any of the jarred baby food that I had stocked up on when his doctor gave us the all clear to start solids, I've developed a few recipes using baby food: baby pancakes, salmon patties and bean burgers. I plan to add to these and others I develop to the website in the future. Stay tuned. . . </p>
