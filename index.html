		<h1>Welcome to My Site!</h1>
		<p>Hello. I am Kerrianne, a web development student at Phoenix Computer Academy.  I am just learning to code in HTML, CSS and Java.  This is my first website and I am practicing what I am learning in my course. I am also a mom to a wonderful 8 month old little boy named James. He started solid foods around the same time I started PCA, so I decided to make this site about that journey.</p>
		<p>In my previous career, I was an adjunct professor who taught nutrition and exercise science.  As I learn more about web design, I am planning to include more nutritonal information on this site.</p>
