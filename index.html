		<h1>Welcome to My Site!</h1>
		<p>Hello. I am Kerrianne, a web development student at Phoenix Computer Academy and am just learning to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  This is my first website, and I am practicing what I am learning in my courses</p>
		<p>In my previous career, I was an adjunct professor who taught nutrition and exercise science, and I am also a mom to a wonderful 8 month old little boy named James who had just started solid foods around the same time I started PCA. My goal with this website is to help other moms by sharing our experience with 'baby-led weaning' and my perspective as a former nutrition educator</p>
		<p>Mouseover the image below of him enjoying one of his first baby-led weaning breakfasts to see how he's doing now.</p>
