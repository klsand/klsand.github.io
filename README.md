<H2> Hello. I am Kerrianne, a web development student at Phoenix Computer Academy </H2>
<br>
<p> I am just learning to code in HTML, CSS and Java.  This is my first website and I am practicing what I am learning in my course.</p>
<p> I am also a mom to a wonderful 8 month old little boy named James. He started solid foods around the same time I started PCA, so I decided to make this site about that journey. </p>
<p> In my previous career, I was an adjunct professor who taught nutrition and exercise science.  As I learn more about web design, I am considering including more nutritonal information on this site. </p>
